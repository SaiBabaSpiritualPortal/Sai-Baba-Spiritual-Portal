                        <p>This is one of the most important sections of our Disclaimer. Please read it carefully and understand it completely before using our Services or following any spiritual practices described on our website.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>Our website shares stories of Sai Baba's miracles, discusses his divine powers, and presents testimonials from devotees who have experienced blessings. However, we must make the following absolutely clear:</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>No Guaranteed Results:</strong> We do NOT guarantee, promise, or represent that you will experience miracles, receive specific blessings, have prayers answered in a particular way, or achieve specific spiritual or material results by following Sai Baba's teachings, performing prayers, conducting worship, or engaging with our content.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>Individual Experiences Vary:</strong> Spiritual experiences, divine grace, and the manifestation of blessings vary greatly among individuals based on countless factors including karma, destiny, faith, sincerity, timing, and divine will. What one devotee experiences may not be replicated by others.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>Faith, Not Magic:</strong> Sai Baba's teachings emphasize genuine faith, patience, surrender, and selfless devotion, not magical formulas or guaranteed outcomes. Spiritual practices are expressions of devotion and should not be undertaken solely for material gain or specific benefits.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>No Supernatural Guarantees:</strong> While we share miracle stories with reverence and authenticity, we do not guarantee that following specific practices, reciting particular prayers, or making offerings will result in supernatural interventions, healings, financial gains, or resolution of problems.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>Divine Will:</strong> According to spiritual philosophy, outcomes are ultimately in accordance with divine will, karma, and destiny. Human understanding of divine plans is limited, and what appears as unanswered prayers may serve higher spiritual purposes.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>Take Practical Action:</strong> While maintaining spiritual faith, also take appropriate practical actions to address life challenges. Spiritual practices should complement, not replace, practical efforts, professional help, medical treatment, or common sense solutions.
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>Avoid Superstition:</strong> We discourage superstitious beliefs, exploitation of faith, or the notion that specific rituals mechanically produce guaranteed results. True spirituality involves sincere devotion, ethical living, and surrender to divine will, not superstitious manipulation.

                    <div class="list-item">
                        <strong>No Claims of Powers:</strong> We do not claim to possess supernatural powers, ability to predict the future, capacity to guarantee divine intervention, or authority to promise specific blessings on behalf of Sai Baba.

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <p><strong>BEWARE OF EXPLOITATION:</strong> Be cautious of anyone who guarantees miracles, promises specific results, demands money for spiritual blessings, claims exclusive access to divine power, or exploits your faith. True spiritual teachers do not exploit devotees or make false promises.</p>
