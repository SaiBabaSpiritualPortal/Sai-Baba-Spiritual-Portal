                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>Namaste and welcome to the Sai Baba Spiritual Portal, a sacred digital space created with pure devotion to share the timeless teachings, miraculous stories, and divine wisdom of Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi. This portal is a humble offering by a devoted follower of Sai Baba, built to spread Baba's universal message of love, faith, patience, and compassion to devotees across the world.</p>
                        
                        <p>This website was born from a sincere desire to serve the Sai community by providing an accessible online sanctuary where individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their religious background, caste, creed, nationality, or spiritual inclination, can connect with Sai Baba's teachings of Shraddha (faith) and Saburi (patience). In today's digital age, many devotees seek authentic spiritual guidance online, and this portal was created to fulfill that sacred need with integrity, authenticity, and devotion.</p>

                        <p>Our platform follows Sai Baba's fundamental principle that spirituality is universal and transcends all man-made boundaries. Just as Sai Baba welcomed people of all faiths to his mosque-temple in Shirdi, this portal is open to everyone seeking spiritual growth, inner peace, and divine guidance. We believe that true spirituality embraces unity in diversity, and Baba's teachings are meant for the entire human family.</p>

                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>Sai Baba Spiritual Portal was created and is maintained by <strong>Afreen Mohammed</strong>, a devoted follower of Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi. As a humble devotee who has experienced Baba's grace and blessings in life, I felt called to create this platform as an act of seva (selfless service) to Sai Baba and the global community of devotees.</p>
                        
                        <p>This website is not run by a large organization or company—it is a personal labor of love, built with devotion, dedication, and the sincere intention to spread Baba's teachings to as many hearts as possible. Every feature, every article, every prayer, and every resource on this portal has been carefully crafted with reverence for Sai Baba and respect for all spiritual seekers.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">My Journey with Sai Baba</h3>
                        <p>Like countless devotees around the world, I have experienced Sai Baba's miraculous presence, divine protection, and loving guidance in my life. During moments of difficulty, doubt, and despair, Baba's grace has lifted me up, shown me the path forward, and filled my heart with peace and faith. Inspired by these personal experiences and the desire to share Baba's love with others, I created this portal.</p>
                        
                        <p>This website is my humble offering to Sai Baba—a digital temple where devotees can come to read His teachings, find comfort in miracle stories, perform virtual worship, seek daily spiritual guidance, and feel connected to Baba's eternal presence. I am deeply grateful to Baba for giving me the opportunity, skills, and inspiration to create this platform and serve the community.</p>

                        <p>We are deeply committed to providing content that is authentic, well-researched, and based on recognized sources such as the Shri Sai Satcharitra, historical records, and documented accounts from Shirdi. We carefully verify information before publication and present Baba's teachings with honesty and integrity. We do not promote superstition, false claims, or unsubstantiated stories that could mislead sincere devotees.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Universal Respect and Inclusivity</h3>
                        <p>Following Sai Baba's own example of welcoming all religions, we maintain complete respect for all faiths, spiritual paths, and traditions. Our content never denigrates, criticizes, or shows disrespect toward any religion, religious figure, spiritual leader, or belief system. We recognize and celebrate that Sai Baba's teachings are universal and can complement any spiritual practice, as Baba himself said: "All paths lead to the same destination."</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Non-Commercial Spiritual Service</h3>
                        <p>This website may display advertisements to support operational costs such as web hosting, domain registration, and technical maintenance. However, our primary motivation is spiritual service (seva), not commercial profit. We do not sell spiritual products, charge fees for spiritual advice, promise miracles in exchange for money, or engage in any exploitative commercial practices. Any minimal revenue generated through legitimate advertising is used solely to maintain and improve the portal's services for the devotee community.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Educational and Devotional Purpose</h3>
                        <p>All content is provided for educational, informational, and devotional purposes. We aim to educate visitors about Sai Baba's life, teachings, and spiritual principles while encouraging critical thinking, personal spiritual development, and direct connection with the Divine. We do not claim to be a religious authority, spiritual guru, or intermediary between devotees and Sai Baba.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Privacy and Simplicity</h3>
                        <p>We deeply respect the privacy of our visitors. We do not collect personal data, track IP addresses, or use invasive analytics. The only information we collect is when devotees voluntarily submit miracle stories or contact us, in which case we collect only the name, email address, and the content they choose to share. We handle this information with utmost care, respect, and in full compliance with privacy principles.</p>
